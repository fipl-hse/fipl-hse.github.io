General Information
===================

This technical track is aimed at building basic skills for retrieving
data from external WWW resources and processing it for future linguistic
research. The idea is to automatically obtain a dataset that has a
certain structure and appropriate content, perform morphological
analysis using various natural language processing (NLP) libraries.

Software solution is built on top of three components:

1. `scraper.py <https://github.com/fipl-hse/2025-2-level-ctlr/blob/main/lab_5_scraper/scraper.py>`__
   - a module for finding articles from the given media, extracting text and dumping it to
   the file system. Students need to implement it.
2. `pipeline.py <https://github.com/fipl-hse/2025-2-level-ctlr/blob/main/lab_6_pipeline/pipeline.py>`__
   - a module for processing text: point-of-speech tagging and basic
   morphological analysis. Students need to implement it.
3. `article.py <https://github.com/fipl-hse/2025-2-level-ctlr/blob/main/core_utils/article/article.py>`__
   - a module for article abstraction to encapsulate low-level manipulations with the article.

Handing over your work
----------------------

1. Lab work is accepted for oral presentation.
2. A student has explained the work of the program and showed it in
   action.
3. A student has completed the mini-task from a mentor that requires some
   slight code modifications.
4. A student receives a mark:

   1. That corresponds to the expected one, if all the steps above are
      completed and mentor is satisfied with the answer.
   2. One point bigger than the expected one, if all the steps above are
      completed and mentor is very satisfied with the answer.
   3. One point smaller than the expected one, if a lab is handed over
      one week later than the deadline and criteria from 4.1 are
      satisfied.
   4. Two points smaller than the expected one, if a lab is handed over
      more than one week later than the deadline and criteria from 4.1
      are satisfied.

.. note:: A student might improve their mark for the lab, if they
          complete tasks of the next level after handing over the lab.

**A lab work is accepted for oral presentation if all the criteria below
are satisfied:**

1. There is a Pull Request (PR) with a correctly formatted name:
   ``Scraper, <NAME> <SURNAME> - <UNIVERSITY GROUP NAME>``.

   1. Example: ``Scraper, Irina Novikova - 20FPL2``.

2. Has a filled file ``settings.json`` with an expected mark.
   Acceptable values: 4, 6, 8, 10.
3. Has green status.
4. Has a label ``done``, set by mentor.
